<h2 class="about.info"> I'm Genesis Leanos. I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. I attend Columbia College Chicago and I am majoring in Interaction Design with a concentration in Web and Mobile Development as well as a Marketing minor. I hope to one day work for a design agency or a company such as Google or Twitter. My main goal is to create websites that are easy to navigate and fun to use as well as develop mobile apps that will help lower-class communitites obtain information and resources that they need to succeed.  </h2>
